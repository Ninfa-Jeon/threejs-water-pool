# A Pool of Water made with Three.js

* The water and its base are made by applying 3D Perlin noise to custom shaders on a plane.
* The water lily models are made to drift over the waves using simple trigonometric sine and cosine functions over axes.
* Experimented with opacity, lighting and tried my best to bring the effect of depth of the water body.
* Referred to multiple forums and discussions online for making water and adding effects to it.

# To-Do

* Add foam around models
* Improve the perception of depth
* Add mouse over effects like ripples and distortion
